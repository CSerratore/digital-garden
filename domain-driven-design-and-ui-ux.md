# Domain Driven Design and UI/UX
A common point of confusion, and potential miscommunication and conflict, arises when UI/UX design meets the architecture of a Domain Driven Design.

The UI design, by definition, determines how users will interact with the system to fulfill their responsibilities as part of one or more business processes in the domain. Therefore, an understanding of the UI/UX expectations and strategy are critical inputs to the _strategic design_ of a system, and may even influence whether DDD is an appropriate choice.
