# A Domain Model Checklist

1. Does the model represent the Ubiquitous Language?
2. Are there any external dependencies?
3. Are all external interactions orchestrated through use cases?
4. Is the model event-driven?
5. Are domain events and integration events distinguished?

I'll revisit and expand on each of the items in this list.
