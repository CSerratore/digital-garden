# A Value Object Checklist

1. Does the object represent the Ubiquitous Language? 
2. Does the object encapsulate the business rule invariants of the domain?
3. Are the business rule invariants enforced at the time of creation?
4. Is the object immutable?
5. Is the object's equivalence based only on its attributes?

I'll revisit and expand on each of the items in this list.
