# Checklist Driven Development

I've learned to appreciate the value of checklists ever since I read (The Checklist Manifesto)[http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/] by Atul Gawande.

Software professionals work in a complex and relatively immature field that is constantly evolving. We juggle a number of responsibilities that rely on a knowledge of computer science theory, principles, disciplines, patterns, best practices, and technologies.

In our attempts to keep up to date on the latest technologies and trends, we often overlook making proper use of what we already know.
